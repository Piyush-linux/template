Am I in danger of being checked? Are any of my pieces hanging or underdefended? Are there any tactics in the position? (opportunities to create a fork, pin, skewer, etc. etc.) Can I place any of my pieces in a more active position? Can I occupy or control any outpost squares or open files? Can I blockade an enemy&#39;s knight or bishop with a pawn push? As you continue to practice and play, you&#39;ll be able to go through this process faster and faster, and with fewer errors.</p><ul><li>Analyze all your games afterwards, especially your losses!</li><li>Remember - it is better to play a few games each week and learn from them, than to play a dozen and learn nothing.</li></ul><p>When studying games, follow the 20/40/40 rule Specifically, this means you should spend 20% of your time studying openings, 40% of your time studying middlegames, and 40% of your time studying endgames (this is in addition to tactics training, playing games, etc.). In order to improve, you have to work on all elements of your game! Don&#39;t get bogged down in memorizing esoteric opening theory and neglect your endgame practice, and vice versa.</p><p>Create a study plan and stick to it (50%) Playing games: Stick to untimed games or games with slow time controls; anything 15|10 or greater. (20%) Game Analysis/Study: Study your games and/or games from game collections. Identify the critical moves and review your key mistakes. (15%) Tactics: Drill tactical puzzles, either online or from tactics books. (10%) Strategy: Choose a good book on the middlegame/general strategy, and go through it at your own pace. (5%) Endgames: Pay special attention to endgame drills! Just as the most strokes are saved with a putter, the most points are won with precise endgame play.</p><p>Work with other chess players Note: this isn&#39;t necessarily limited to getting a coach. A higher-rated player can act as a mentor, someone with whom you can discuss your games, successes, struggles, and areas to improve. Ideally, such a mentor should be in a good position to give you advice on what went wrong, and look over positions with you. On the flip side, you can also work with a lower-rated chess player by trying to train and teach them! Training other players can actually help improve your own game; explaining different concepts out loud in detail can help you understand them at a higher level. Many of the most successful chess coaches are not high-rated GMs, but lower-level FMs and CMs who have a flair for explaining ideas and strategies.</p><p>Pick up a good book (or three) The /r/chess wiki has extensive recommendations for reading material of all types. Books on opening theory are not necessary at lower levels, but at any given time you should be studying one book on tactics, one book on middlegames, and one book on endgames. For example, a given beginner could be studying the following three books at any given time:</p><p>Chess Tactics for Students by John Bain</p><p>Modern Chess Strategy by Ludek Pachman</p><p>Silman&#39;s Complete Endgame Course by IM Jeremy Silman</p><p>Most importantly, have fun!! Every grandmaster of the highest calibre was once a beginner - ipso facto, you&#39;re going to lose, a lot, as you improve. But that&#39;s part and parcel of the improvement process. Don&#39;t consider a lost game as a personal failure, but rather as another step on the road towards improvement. If you&#39;re bogged down in a losing streak and getting frustrated, just take a break! Step away from the board for a few hours, a few days, or even a week. The next game isn&#39;t going anywhere - it&#39;ll be waiting for you when you feel comfortable enough to return ðŸ˜ƒ</p><hr><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Resources&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li>lichess &amp; lichess prettier</li><li>Stydy : <a href="https://listudy.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://listudy.org/en</a></li><li>Analysis : <a href="https://www.openingtree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.openingtree.com/</a></li><li>Course : <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/chess-university-intro-to-chess-crash-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.udemy.com/course/chess-university-intro-to-chess-crash-course/</a></li><li><a href="https://chess-endgame-trainer.web.app/position/7/0/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chess-endgame-trainer.web.app/position/7/0/0</a></li><li><a href="https://www.chessercise.xyz/lessons/8aeac71b-9c3f-48c5-88c4-baf897dea61d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.chessercise.xyz/lessons/8aeac71b-9c3f-48c5-88c4-baf897dea61d</a></li><li>Books : <a href="https://beginchess.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://beginchess.com/downloads/</a></li></ul><p>Tactics Chesstempo â€“ Puzzles, puzzles, and more puzzles.
